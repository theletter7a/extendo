# extendo
Make absurd chrome extensions with ease! With extendo, you can edit CSS properties, import scripts, and customize your manifest.json with a single YAML file. Just make sure not to do anyting too stupid or else I'll look like an idiot for creating this. Like seriously, if I get one fucking email about XSS attacks or viruses I will kill myself.
